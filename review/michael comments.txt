It is already in very good shape, there mostly minor things. I did not like so much the term "reversibility" you have been using. Intuitively, one would connect this term to how reversible a process is in the sense of thermodynamics, which certainly does not fit to the detachment process, which will be strongly irreversible in any case. That is why I suggest to use a different term throuhgout the manuscript.
The last paragraph is at the moment mainly a summary rather than a conclusion.
One point that could interesting to think about (but is maybe not necessary unless a referee asks): we look at forces - how would the picture change for energy? Other way: does the animal save in the sense of reduced force but loses energy more energy for the tilting. For this one would have to compare the maximum elastic energy stored in hairs and backing layer before release at zero angle and to the elastic energy stored in system with tilt (should be in first order be related to the area under the force curves).
