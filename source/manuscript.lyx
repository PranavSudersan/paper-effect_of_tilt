\begin_layout Abstract
Many creatures ranging from geckos to beetles can easily climb on surfaces
 with the help of hairy adhesive pads on their legs.
 The hairy pad's design allows the animal to rapidly switch between strong
 adhesion during attachment and weak adhesion during detachment.
 Several studies explain this mechanism based on the asymmetric geometry
 of the hairs, which imparts direction dependent adhesion properties.
 Here, we propose a mechanism for controlling adhesion of a hairy pad based
 on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spring contact model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We show that the adhesion force can be decreased by an order of magnitude
 just by slightly tilting the pad during pull-off.
 Further, deformation of the pad's soft backing layer can trigger its spontaneou
s detachment at low tilt angles.
 Our model provides a new approach to switch the adhesion state in bio-inspired
 synthetic adhesives without the need of asymmetric structures.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the past few decades, there has been numerous studies to understand
 how animals such as geckos and insects are able to walk on surfaces defying
 gravity.
 A microscopic observation reveals that, in many cases, animals have a dense
 array of hairy structures at the end of their legs

\end_inset

.
 These hairy adhesive pads help the animal to stay attached to any surface,
 supporting its weight, and detach easily at will.
 Previous attempts to theoretically explain adhesion in hairy pads
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 has followed two fundamental approaches: either by energy balance, or by
 force balance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the energy balance approach, adhesion is characterized by

\end_inset

work of adhesion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (W
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
adh
\end_layout

\end_inset

) which is the energy required to separate two surfaces from contact.
 During detachment, elastic energy stored in the hair is dissipated, which
 increases W
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
adh
\end_layout

\end_inset

and thus adhesion is enhanced
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RN29,RN114"

\end_inset

.
 Detachment of the pad can be explained based on Kendall's peeling theory
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN147"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which predicts low forces at high peeling angles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the force balance approach, adhesion is characterized by pull-off force
 (F
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
p
\end_layout

\end_inset

) or stress (σ
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

), which is the maximum force necessary to separate two surfaces from contact.
 Based on a

 has identified two regimes of hair detachment: 1) flaw sensitive regime,
 where contact failure occurs due to crack propagation leading to low σ

 has shown that the spatula shaped hair tips in a gecko's toe allows it
 change adhesion by three orders of magnitude by laterally sliding and controlli
ng the pulling angle.
 Federle
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 has further argued that curved shape of hairs helps the pad to stay attached
 when pulled proximally, and easily detached by elastic recoil when pushed
 distally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theories presented so far suggests that low detachment force of a hairy
 pad can be attained by 1) increasing the stress concentration by peeling
 the pad at high angles, or 2) laterally shearing the pad before pull-off,
 which requires the hairs have an asymmetric geometry.
 Fabricating synthetic mimics with asymmetric micro hair structures however
 are generally difficult.
 It is thus desired to have alternate strategies to achieve reversible adhesion
 suited for practical applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work, we present a new method of detachment by changing the tilt
 of the pad relative to the surface.
 Tilling the pad will result in an elastic penalty due to the deformation
 of hairs, which can potentially reduce the net pull-off force.
 To investigate this, we model the hairy pad by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

spring contact model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This model is based on the force-balance approach, which assumes the hairy
 pad to behave like an array of springs.
 We hope our work to provide new strategies to control adhesion force of
 an artificial micro-pillar adhesive, with applications in bio inspired
 robotic systems.

 The hairs are attached to a backing layer, assumed to be another spring

 The hairs are spaced apart with width w.

We consider three modes of detachment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Simultaneous detachment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All hairs detach simultaneously when 𝜃 = 0°.
 Here the hairy pad shows the maximum possible adhesion, given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{adh}=N_{t}f_{p}\label{eq:simul_detach}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Sequential detachment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 𝜃 > 0°, the hairs will detach sequentially from left to right (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Schematic"
plural "false"

\end_inset

).
 Let us consider the situation when the left most spring is stretched to
 its maximum length, l
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
h,p
\end_layout

\end_inset

, just before pull-off.
 The net force on the pad when n hairs are in contact with the surface is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{net}\left(n\right)=\stackrel[i=1]{n}{\sum}k_{h}\left(l_{h,i}-l_{h,0}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be simplified into:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{net}\left(n\right)=nf_{p}-\frac{n\left(n-1\right)}{2}k_{h}w\sin\theta & \qquad & n\geq N_{t}\label{eq:seq_detach}

 hairs can then be calculated as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{adh} & = & \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{f_{p}}{2}\left[\frac{f_{p}}{k_{h}w\sin\theta}+1\right]+\frac{k_{h}w\sin\theta}{8} & \qquad & N_{t}\geq N_{max}\\
N_{t}f_{p}-\frac{N_{t}\left(N_{t}-1\right)}{2}k_{h}w\sin\theta & \qquad & N_{t}<N_{max}
\end{array}\right.\label{eq:seq_adh}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N_{max}=\frac{f_{p}}{k_{h}w\sin\theta}+\frac{1}{2}\label{eq:n_max}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, N
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 is the number of hairs required to get maximum adhesion at a fixed tilt
 angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Detachment propagation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us consider a special case of sequential detachment where the backing
 layer deforms.
 When a hair detaches from the surface, the backing layer undergoes an elastic
 recoil due to an unbalanced force.
 Suppose the backing layer spring relaxes upward by a length Δl (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Schematic"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 For n hairs in contact, the force balance before and after a hair detaches
 is given respectively by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\stackrel[i=1]{n}{\sum}k_{h}\left(l_{h,i}-l_{h,0}\right)=k_{b}\left(l_{b}-l_{b,0}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\stackrel[i=1]{n-1}{\sum}k_{h}\left(l_{h,i}+\Delta l-l_{h,0}\right)=k_{b}\left(l_{b}-\Delta l-l_{b,0}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving the above two equations for Δl, we get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta l=\frac{f_{p}}{k_{h}\left(n-1\right)+k_{b}}\label{eq:backing_deform}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The length difference between the detached hair and its adjacent hair just
 before it breaks contact is 
\begin_inset Formula $w\sin\theta$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l>w\sin\theta$
\end_inset

, the adjacent hair will be stretched more than l
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
h,p
\end_layout

\end_inset

and thus also detach.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:backing_deform"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that Δl increases for lesser number of hairs in contact.
 This implies that hair detachment will propagate and the pad completely
 breaks contact with the surface.
 The critical number of hairs, N
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
c
\end_layout

\end_inset

, necessary for detachment propagation at a given tilt angle is thus given
 by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N_{c}=\frac{f_{p}}{k_{h}w\sin\theta}-\frac{k_{b}}{k_{h}}+1\label{eq:prop_nc}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, for a given pad with N
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
t
\end_layout

\end_inset

 hairs, the critical tilt angle below which detachment propagates is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\theta_{c}=\arcsin\left[\frac{f_{p}}{k_{h}w}\left(\frac{1}{\frac{k_{b}}{k_{h}}+N-1}\right)\right]\label{eq:prop_thetac}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hairs will propagate when n < N
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
c
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 𝜃 < 𝜃
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
c
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If we assume the hairs to be softer than the backing layer (i.e.
 k
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
b
\end_layout

\end_inset

/k
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 > 1), then from equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
c
\end_layout

\end_inset

 < N
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This implies that, for a given pad with N

\end_inset

 hairs, the adhesion force will be given by equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:seq_adh"

\end_inset

, like sequential detachment.
 The backing layer deformation has no effect on the adhesion.
 It only affects the dynamics by spontaneous detachment of hairs when n

 or 𝜃 < 𝜃

, independent of the retraction speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our analysis, we define non-dimensional forces as below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{f}_{p}=\frac{f_{p}}{k_{h}w} & \hat{F}_{net}=\frac{F_{net}}{k_{h}w} & \hat{F}_{adh}=\frac{F_{adh}}{k_{h}w}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f_{p}}$
\end_inset

 is a parameter which encapsulates the hair's adhesion force, stiffness
 and geometry.
 Positive force values represent attraction by convention.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Detachment mechanism:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three modes of detachment can be understood by looking at the net force
 as hairs detach from the surface (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Mechanism-of-detachment"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 We use equations

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:prop_nc"

\end_inset

 to describe the forces.
 Let us assume that the pad has N
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
t
\end_layout

\end_inset

=25 hairs.
 We consider two cases: a pad with stiff backing (k
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

→
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

) and a pad with soft backing (k

\begin_layout Plain Layout
b
\end_layout

\end_inset

/k
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 = 10).
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Mechanism-of-detachment"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that by increasing the tilt angle, the detachment force shows lower
 attraction or even repulsion as the hairs detach sequentially.
 Tilting the pad compresses the hairs at one end, which ultimately results
 in a decrease in the net force.
 In comparison, when the hairs detach simultaneously (i.e.
 𝜃 = 0°), the pad shows much larger attractive force.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a stiff backing, the detachment progresses smoothly for both values
 of 𝜃.
 For a soft backing, we observe that for a tilt angle of 2°, the force abruptly
 drops to zero after the 6
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
th
\end_layout

\end_inset

 hair breaks contact (n = 20).
 This represents the spontaneous propagation of hair detachment as a result
 of the elastic recoil of the backing layer once the 6
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
th
\end_layout

\end_inset

 hair snaps off.
 No such force drop is seen when 𝜃 = 8°, because N
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
c
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is too small.
 Thus here, the hairs detach exactly like for a pad with stiff backing.

Effect of tilt on adhesion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The adhesion force, which is the maxima of the force curves from Figure

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f_{p}}$
\end_inset

 and number of hairs (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Adhesion-force-of"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Adhesion force obviously increases with increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f_{p}}$
\end_inset

, due to the stronger pull-off force of the individual hairs.
 For a fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f_{p}}$
\end_inset

, adhesion force decreases with increasing tilt angles until a minima, then
 increases again.
 This is because, the net force on a tilted pad depends on a balance between
 the stretched hairs, on one end, and the compressed hairs, on the other
 end.
 When the pad is tilted, initially the compressed hair dominates in its
 contribution to the new force and thus adhesion force initially decreases.
 On further tilting, more number of stretched hairs increases and eventually
 dominates the force contribution.
 This results in an increase in adhesion force at large tilt angles.
 We can calculate the minimum force F
\begin_inset script subscript

 and angle 𝜃

 Maximum adhesion is seen when 𝜃 = 0°, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{max}=F_{adh}=N_{t}f_{p}$

We can think of r to represent the

 A large value of r implies a greater difference between the maximum and
 minimum possible adhesion in a hairy pad, and thus more suitable to achieve
 reversible adhesion.

 implies that having a larger number hairs favor reversible adhesion.
 Adhesion can be controlled just be changing the tilt of the pad.

\begin_layout Standard
The hairy pad must have a reasonable value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f_{p}}$
\end_inset

 such that 𝜃

 is small enough to be practically feasible.
 If we restrict 𝜃
\begin_inset script subscript

\end_inset

 to lie below 10°, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f_{p}}\leq0.1$

 (Figure

) will be the constraint to be considered when designing bio-inspired artificial
 mimics.
 In live animals, as far as our knowledge, there is no experimental evidence
 that it can modulate adhesion by changing its pad's tilt.
 If we consider the case of a dock beetle

, its pointed tipped hair has a pull off force and spring constant of 0.1
 μN and 0.2 Nm

\end_inset

respectively, while its disc tipped hair have the corresponding values of
 0.9 μN and 0.7 Nm

receptively.
 The beetle's hairs are approximately spaced apart by 10 μm.
 We can thus calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f_{p}}$
\end_inset

 for the beetle's pointed and disc tipped hairs to be 0.05 and 0.13 respectively.
 Since both types of hairs are present in the beetle's pad, let us thus
 assume an effective 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f_{p}}$
\end_inset

 = 0.1.
 Assuming the pad to have 100 hairs, a one dimensional analogue of the system
 will put N

 =10 in our model.
 From Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we see that the beetle can reduce its adhesion force up to 10 times by
 tilting its pad to roughly 10°.
 Thus, the model seems consistent with nature's design of the beetle's pad.
 Further experimental investigation is required to prove if such a tilting
 mechanism is employed by animals to switch adhesion.

Spontaneous propagation of detachment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presence of a soft backing layer can trigger a spontaneous detachment of
 hairs which propagates by elastic recoil as the they are detached sequentially.
 Such a mode of detachment is triggered when the tilt angle is less than
 a critical value, 𝜃

 A softer backing layer (i.e.

 shifts 𝜃

 to higher values, thus increasing the available range of tilt angles to
 trigger spontaneous detachment (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This is explained from equation

 will increase the backing layer's elastic recoil when a hair breaks contact,
 thus increasing 𝜃

 However, we see that larger value of N

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see a trade-off in the conditions for reducing adhesion or to trigger
 spontaneous detachment.
 Low

 is favorable to trigger spontaneous detachment within a feasible 𝜃

 Depending on whether a higher range of controllable adhesion or an instantaneou

 the design of artificial adhesive suited for the particular application.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have proposed a method to control the adhesion of a hairy adhesive pad
 by changing the tilt.
 Increasing the tilt reduces adhesion due to the elastic force balance between
 the compressed and stretched hairs.
 Based on the spring contact model, we show that increasing the number of
 hairy structures will enhance the range of tunable adhesion force.
 Further, having a soft backing layer can trigger a spontaneous detachment
 of hairs as a result of its elastic recoil.
 High N

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f_{p}}\leq0.1$
\end_inset

 is suitable for enhancing reversibility of adhesion.
 One the other hand, low N

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f_{p}}\geq0.1$
\end_inset

 and softer backing layer favors spontaneous detachment.
 The model is consistent with the design of a dock beetle's hairy pad and
 provides new strategies to design artificial reversible adhesives.
